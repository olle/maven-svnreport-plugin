 This is a small, and very simple, plug-in for Maven, that generates a
 report from the SVN repository of the project it is used in.

 Everything is up to convention at this point, so the plug-in assumes
 the common style of structure in a Subversion repo:

 branches/
 tags/
 trunk/

 If the repository is setup like this, the plug-in can generate the a
 report showing the current line of tagged releases.

 Versions are of course also down to convention, and at the moment the
 plug-in only knows the common Maven version format:

 [some-project-name]-[major].[minor].[patch]

 For example: my-project-1.2.0

 If this type of versioning is strictly used, the plug-in report will
 show a list of releases where patches are horizontal and each major-
 minor release are listed vertically.
 
 To use it, do the following:

 1) Checkout and install the plug-in:
    > git clone git@github.com:olle/maven-svnreport-plugin.git
    > cd maven-svnreport-plugin
    > mvn install

 2) Add the artifact config to the reporting section of a POM:
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.studiomediatech</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-svnreport-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...

 3) Just run the site generation goal and enjoy:
    > mvn site

 Good luck!
